### User Stories :telescope:

1. Users will be able to look through the various problems and complete them according to the instructions.
2. Users, if completing this by themselves, will be able to become a master coder and get a good job.
3. This repository should cover the main data structures, namely:
   - practice of arrays
   - objects
   - maps
   - sets
4. This repository will also include practical problems that they may need to solve, such as
5. The answer section should provide a comprehensive answer, as well as an explanation as to why that is a good answer.
